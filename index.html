      <h1>Welcome to my little UX design space</h1>
      <p class="headline-text">
        Hi, I am Marcela - an enthusiast who likes to deal with UX design and digital design in general in her spare time. I believe that in today's age of ubiquitous technology, an appropriately focused design can delight, entertain and inspire users. That is my main motivation.    </p>

          In the customer journey map I captured important moments of the user when interacting with the new application. For the creation of the map I had a video recording from the testing of the application by a real user.

         In this story map, you can find a description of the steps that should be included in the book borrowing application. The map can serve as a basis for the work of developers. Features are divided into phases: MVP and Release 2 and 3.

          Draft of 3 versions of a moodboard for a new clothing brand. The brand wants to look rebellious and focuses on young clients. Moodboards were created in Figma based on the brief. You can find all 3 versions in the link.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Nice to meet you! Maybe you do not know me yet so I will introduce myself a bit. I like to follow my intuition and go into things that I feel are meant to be. This is for example the reason why I played amateur theater for eight years or raised an assistance dog. In terms of design, I believe that creating anything works as therapy. You just forget the time and don't think about anything else. To balance the mental work, I like to do sports. My favourites are tennis, cycling and yoga.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my career, I worked for a couple of software companies and e-commerce companies. There I realized that the path to a satisfied customer leads through simplicity, functionality and authenticity. I am convinced, that if UX design follows these rules, the website / app is headed for success.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the coming period, I would like to focus more on animation and motion design in my digital work. I like how this type of technology can help convey more than just words.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are interested in cooperation regarding UX design, I can process all parts of the design creation for you - from brief, moodboard, empathy map, customer journey map, storymapping, wireframe, mockup, prototype, testing to design optimization.
